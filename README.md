# VoterWeb

This project, in its original form, served as the final project in my college web development course. Recently, I went back in and made several modifications - changes to the color of the "states" navigation menu as well as changing the data from that given in the project for the Minnesota Congressional elections to that of each state. On that side, I changed the data to use that of the 2020 election and updated the bar graphs to a darker shade of red, blue, and added green for third party. At this time, only the Congressional election results for each state are included as well as the first few states' Senate election results.
